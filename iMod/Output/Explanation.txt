In "imode_ic.evec", the following information can be found:

1) The eigenvalue for each mode (which represents the frequency of said vibration)
2) The coresponding eigenvector for each dihedral angle.

The imove_1.pdb and imove_10.pdb files contain a visualization of the lowest/highest frequency modes.

Upsides: statically linked libraries, no install needed; easy-to-parse output.
Downsides: Not in Python.
